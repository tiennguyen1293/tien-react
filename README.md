This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  config/
    jest/
    env.js
    paths.js
    webpack.config.dev.js
    webpack.config.prod.js
    webpackDevServer.config.js
  node_modules/
  package.json
  README.md
  scripts/
    build.js
    start.js
    test.js
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    i18n/
      en.json
    layouts/
      components/
      shared/
    pages/
      App/
      Home/
      About/
    store/
    index.css
    AppWrapper.jsx
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers.<br>
Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).

### Supported Language Features

This project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.<br>
In addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:

- [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).
- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).
- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018).
- [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 3 proposal)
- [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (part of stage 3 proposal).
- [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) syntax.

Learn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).

While we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.

Note that **this project includes no [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md)** by default.

If you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are [including the appropriate polyfills manually](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md), or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.

## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor

To configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.

## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.<br>
> It also only works with npm 3 or higher.

Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.

They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.

You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:

```js
{
  "extends": "react-app"
}
```

Now your editor should report the linting warnings.

Note that even if you edit your `.eslintrc` file further, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won’t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.

If you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.
